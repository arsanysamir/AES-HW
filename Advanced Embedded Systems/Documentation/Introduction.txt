The Electricity Measuring System is a  prototype designed to measure and observe current, voltage and the temperature of an industrial factory or a lab. As a safety feature the prototype is capable of give alerts/warning  system and take the necessary safety actions. The user can keep a track on the system with a mobile device or a laptop . In case of emergency the user is capable of terminate the malfunctioning/ failing sections of the electrical system remotely.

In order to gained the previously explained capabilities, it is required to implement a wireless sensor network. The Raspberry pi 3 players a as the central system and the data processing and transfer unit of the  prototype. MQTT (Message queuing Telemetry Transport) protocol is used to transfer signal wirelessly. The current sensor, voltage sensor and the temperature sensor has connected to an Arduino Wi-Fi Rev 2 which act as the nodes of the wireless sensor network.  This Arduino work as a publisher to the broker to transfer the measurements.   
This system is implemented by using Internet of things. Raspberry pi is connected to the internet and use the cloud technology to process and store measurements from the sensors, record of a publishers, commands etc.
